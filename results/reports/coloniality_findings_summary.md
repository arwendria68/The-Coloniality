# COLONIALITY RESEARCH FINDINGS SUMMARY

## Executive Summary
Analysis of 4,920 publications reveals significant epistemic inequality between Global South and Global North research landscapes.

## Key Findings

### 1. Epistemic Dominance Pattern
- **Global North**: 95% dominated by "Library and Information Science (LIS)"
- **Global South**: More balanced distribution (39% LIS, 36% IS, 24% LS)

### 2. Epistemic Marginalization
- **Information Science (IS)**: 36.3% in GS vs 1.5% in GN (+34.8% gap)
- **Library Science (LS)**: 24.4% in GS vs 1.5% in GN (+22.9% gap)
- **LIS**: 39.0% in GS vs 95.0% in GN (-56.0% gap)

### 3. Epistemic Diversity
- **Global South**: 5 distinct epistemic categories
- **Global North**: 3 distinct epistemic categories  
- **Unique categories**: GS has 2 categories not found in GN

## Research Implications

### Coloniality of Knowledge
The data reveals a clear pattern of epistemic hegemony where:
- Global North maintains dominance in broad categories (LIS)
- Specialized fields (IS, LS) are marginalized in Global North
- Global South shows greater epistemic pluralism

### Decolonial Insights
1. **Epistemic Justice**: Need for recognition of marginalized knowledge categories
2. **Pluralism**: Value of diverse epistemic approaches in GS
3. **Hegemony**: Critical examination of LIS dominance in academic publishing

## Methodological Notes
- Data sources: 1,752 GS publications vs 3,170 GN publications
- Time range: 2015-2025
- Epistemic categories based on standardized classification

## Next Research Directions
1. Qualitative analysis of category definitions and boundaries
2. Historical analysis of epistemic category evolution
3. Power dynamics in category creation and maintenance
4. Impact on research funding and institutional support
